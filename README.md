1. import the required libraries.
2. download the data and set key variables.
3. create data(train, validation and test) generator use `ImageDataGenerator`
    `ImageDataGenerator` to read and decode the images and convert them into floating point tensors.
4. create a model use the Keras Sequential model.
5. use `fit` method  to train and validate the network.
6. test the model.
